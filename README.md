- 👋 Hi, I’m @musty-codified.
- 👀 I am a professional Software developer with experience building scalable and highly available distributed microservices as well as monoliths. I work primarily on things around 
      server-side development using the Java stack. My expetise lies in using various Java tools such as Spring, Hibernate, and JPA.

    I have a solid understanding of modular and object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. I am also familiar with SQL and MongoDB databases.

    In addition to my technical skills, I am a team player and communicate honestly and directly. I am always eager to learn and continuously improve my skills.
